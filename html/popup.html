            <p class="lp-faq-q">  Do I need to have good credit?</p>
            <p> Having good credit is not part of our general requirements but we will utilize a variety of information from consumer reporting agencies to evaluate your approval/denial worthiness.</p>

            <p class="lp-faq-q">  Can I get more than one product?</p>
            <p> Yes, you may lease any number of products up to your approved spending limit.</p>
            <p class="lp-faq-q">  What is a Lease?</p>
            <p> A lease is a contract between a lessor (the property owner) and a lessee (the property user) for the use of property subject to stated terms and limitations for a specified period and at a specified payment.</p>
            <p class="lp-faq-q">  How does the lease work?</p>
            <p> With a lease, you are agreeing to make weekly payments for a specific amount of time (the initial lease term) which may vary by state. If you provide us with 30 days' notice before the end of the initial lease term, make all of your required payments during the initial lease term, and return the item back to us in good condition, you have no further obligation to FlexShopper. If you do not provide us with timely notice, then the lease typically rolls over for the same period as the initial lease term; please be sure to read your lease before electronically signing for the exact terms. You can also buy the item at any time by using the Early Payment Option. Simply refer to the table in your lease to look up the Early Payment Option amount. Remember, if you don't choose the Early Payment Option, just make 52 weekly payments and you own the product.</p>
            <p class="lp-faq-q">  Can I own the product?</p>
            <p> You can buy the item at any time by using the Early Payment Option. Simply refer to the table in your lease to look up the Early Payment Option amount. Remember, if you don't choose the Early Payment Option, just make 52 weekly payments and you own the product.</p>
            <p class="lp-faq-q">  How long is the lease?</p>
            <p> With a lease, you are agreeing to make weekly payments for a specific amount of time (the initial lease term) which may vary by state but ranges from 89 days to 20 weeks. If you provide us with 30 days' notice before the end of the initial lease term, make all of your required payments during the initial lease term, and return the item back to us in good condition, you have no further obligation to FlexShopper. If you do not provide us with timely notice, then the lease typically rolls over for the same period as the initial lease term; please be sure to read your lease before electronically signing for the exact terms.</p>
            <p class="lp-faq-q">  What is the Cash Price?</p>
            <p> The cash price is the amount you would have paid online or at a store to buy the item(s) or the “retail” price of the product.</p>
            <p class="lp-faq-q">  What is 90 Days Same as Cash?</p>
            <p>  If you pay the cash price of the item, plus shipping, sales tax and a $50 processing fee within the first ninety days of the Lease's effective date you will own the item(s). You will not have to make any more payments for the item(s). The cash price for the product will be disclosed on your lease agreement prior to your signing and agreeing to the terms of the lease.</p>
            <p class="lp-faq-q">  What's my payment?</p>
            <p> Your payments will be weekly, on Fridays. The first payment will be on the first Friday after you receive your items. Your actual payment amount will be disclosed in your lease agreement prior to your signing and agreeing to the terms of the lease.</p>
            <p class="lp-faq-q">  Can I return the merchandise?</p>
            <p>A customer may return the leased product in accordance with the terms in their Lease Agreement.</p>
            <p class="lp-faq-q">  Do you pull my credit score?</p>
            <p> While having good credit is not a requirement for approval, as part of our application we do obtain information about you including a credit report from FactorTrust, Inc. or Clarity Services, Inc.</p>
            <p class="lp-faq-q">  Do you report to credit bureaus/can you help build my credit?</p>
            <p> We only report to FactorTrust, Inc. or Clarity Services, Inc. which is an FCRA compliant credit reporting agency. We do not expect that your experience with us will have a significant (if any) impact on your credit score with any other credit bureau.</p>
